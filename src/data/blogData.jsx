  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Why Advanced Pilot Training Matters</h2>
  <p class="font-sans mb-4">Becoming a pilot involves much more than simply logging flight hours; it requires understanding decision-making and expertise in technical skills and safety. With flying becoming increasingly complex, airlines and employers want pilots to demonstrate a higher level of performance, far beyond the minimum levels. Advanced training means that pilots are:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-sans mb-6">

    <li>Current with modern simulator training</li>
    <li>Knowledgeable regarding FAA and DGCA aviation safety</li>
    <li>Proficiently prepared for multi-pilot and multi-FIR navigation</li>
