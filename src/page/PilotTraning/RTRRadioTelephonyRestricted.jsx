              In aviation, effective communication is essential to ensure safety
              and efficiency while flying. RTR training allows pilots to
              communicate with air traffic control (ATC) and other aircraft
              safely and effectively while following protocols and procedures.
              <br /> <br />
              Our institution believes that RTR training is very important in
              completing a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) and beyond. Here are
              some great examples of why RTR training is important in CPL
              education:
