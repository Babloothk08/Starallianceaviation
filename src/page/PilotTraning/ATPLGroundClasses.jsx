Navigation includes traditional methods of pilotage and dead reckoning before you get into the modern world of navigation systems, including GPS and inertial navigation. So the ATPL students will study these basic navigation principles, processes, and equipment thoroughly.",

It contains a range of techniques and systems that allow pilots to navigate both safely and accurately, whether in difficult weather conditions or flying from one airport to another over a long distance. Pilots can navigate using traditional VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range) or advanced GPS (Global Positioning System), using radio navigation technology to navigate precisely and with positional information and location or directional cues.",
