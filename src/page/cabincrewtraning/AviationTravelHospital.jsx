                            The Aviation Management & Operations Course offered at Star Alliance Aviation Academy strives to provide students with solid basics to begin working in an aviation career path. The course covers the main parts of aviation operations, ground handling, air traffic awareness and management, flight safety, and passenger management.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Students learn the functions of the aviation ecosystem under the guidance of experienced instructors and recognized facilitators from the industry, from airport coordination to flight dispatching and ensuring compliance with safety regulations.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            At Star Alliance, our previous industry background allows us to differentiate our educational approach from traditional teaching. Students are exposed to aviation simulations, airport handling modules, and airline procedures, which assists in their preparation for productive operational delivery in compliance with Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) standards.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The course also includes the necessary foundations in communications, self-discipline, and a professional attitude to assist students in integrating into a domestic or international airline.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            By the end of the skiing management & operations course, students will transition confidently into their first employment experience as a separate airport operations executive, airline ground staff, or aviation coordinator with strong technical and people skills.
